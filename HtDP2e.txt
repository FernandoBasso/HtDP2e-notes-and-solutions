To review you don't need your tablet so that you can review when you are somewhere without a proper computer. Reviewing takes some time, and it is part of your studying hours.

“
To follow a section, you want to keep all definitions in one file and you want to update definitions as they are revised. 

To solve problems, start a new file. If an exercise tells you to resume a section’s work, include the section’s definitions. If exercise n tells you to resume exercise k (for k < n), copy the work from there into the file for n.

But I want to get students in the mind set — look at the docs — because programmers must learn to look at docs. Unless they want to stay Stackoverflow coders. ([[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/PdtHCydMNt4/nfN66wb9CgAJ|link]])

If you want to study the book, and they tell you to try all the image examples and fiddle with them, but you don't want to, then you don't want to study the book. It takes time. Accept it.
